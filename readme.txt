== Installation ==

SETTING THE BASE COLOR SCHEME
1. Locate css folder, you have all the colors in there
2. Choose your color
3. Open the file, copy the content
4. Open “colors.css”, replace content with the content of your color file

GETTING THE TEMPLATE ONLINE
1. It's important to understand that you must either have your own server space or use someone elses. The server space can be purchased at many different places around the internet. You need somewhere to put the files that you purchased so others can find them online.
2. The template folder will have several files with the extension labeled .html. This is where all your content will. It's very important to keep the css and js-plugin folders with the HTML or the HTML will not look how the design is meant to look. Along with the HTML files, you will also have four additional folders to upload: css, font-icons, bootstrap, js-plugin, images, and js.
3. Start your FTP client (we personally use Filezila which is free) and login. Login to your server. You will need your server name (often times this will be your domain name), username, and password that you setup with the hosting company.
4. Locate the domain folder you wish to upload your template files to on your server. You are going to want to click and drag every file into your FTP client.
5. Once the files are done uploading, rename the file you want to be your home page as 'index.html'.
